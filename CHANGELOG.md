- [reorg] move independent modules into visidata/{features|experimental|themes}
- [sidebar] add sidebar  #2064
    - #1733 for full description/discussion
    - will contain a stack list of status messages
    - color syntax is [:bold]footext[/]
        - supports `[:code]`, `[:bold]`, `[:italic]`, `[:underline]`, `[:onclick]` (makes a clickable link)
        - [:] at terminal clears; [/] at terminal pops
    - toggle with `sidebar-toggle` (bound to `b`)

    When `disp_help` is:
    - -1: status messages aren't shown
    - 0: no help is shown
    - 1: sidebar sheet help is shown
    - 2: help is shown for the input widget on the sidebar (this was condensed and moved from the former input help panel)  #2085 #1961

            - "bg *bg* fg *fg*" (or reversed)
            - attributes always apply to foreground regardless of position in colorstr
            - as before, only the first valid color in a category (fg/bg) is used; subsequent color names (even unknown ones) are ignored
        - allocate colors on demand, instead of "all" 256 colors as fg

        - [splitwin] allows stickier panes for push/quit
    - [splitwin] splitwin-half (`Z`) swaps panes if already active
    - [splitwin] only re-split (with `zZ`) if sheets are not already split, otherwise adjust split percent

## man
    - add a manpage visidata.1
    - fix typo

# v2.2 (2021-01-30)

## Options

    - [cli options] now global by default; use `-n` to set option as sheet-specific instead
        - add `-n`/`--nonglobal` to make subsequent CLI options "sheet-specific" (applying only to paths specified directly on the CLI)
        - keep `-g`/`--global` to make subsequent CLI options "global" (applying to all sheets by default unless overridden)
        - invert the default: now CLI options are global by default (thus `-g` is a no-op unless preceded by `-n` on the CLI)
        - `-g` no longer acts as a toggle

    - [input] add `options.input_history` (thanks @tsibley and @ajkerrigan #468)
        - basename of file to store persistent input history (default of `''` means disabled)
        - caveat: persistent file only read if option given before first input

    - [options.fancy_chooser] now disabled by default--use `Ctrl+X` to open from a choose() prompt

## Types

    - [types] add `floatlocale` type (thanks @Guiriguanche #863)
        - add commands `type-floatlocale` and `type-floatlocale-selected` (unbound by default)
        - `floatlocale` parses based on `LC_NUMERIC` envvar (must be set before launching)
        - parsing is 20x slower than with standard float column
        - will parse commas as decimals (e.g. '1,1') if LC_NUMERIC is set to a locale like 'en_DK.UTF-8'

## Loaders

    - [loaders geojson] add loading and saving support for geojson files (thanks @draco #876)
    - [loaders vds] add loader/saver for custom .vds format (VisiData Sheet) to save column properties and data for multiple sheets in one file
    - [ux] autoload all subsheets by default; set `options.load_lazy` to disable
        - removes a minor friction with unloaded subsheets

    - [expand] errors and nulls can now be expanded with `expand-cols` (thanks @geekscrapy #865)

    - [open] openSource now uses **'global'** `options.filetype` instead of sheet-specific as previous
        - to set the filetype for a file locally, set through cli: `vd -f tsv sample.foo`
        - to set in the **CommandLog**, use sheet="global" with longname="set-option"

    - [loaders http] raise exception if http status is not 20x (thanks @geekscrapy #848)
    - [loaders shp] support more Shapefile types (thanks @dracos #875)

## API
    - add `create` kwarg to `openSource()`, to create the file if it does not exist already
    - [settings] 'global' is now 'default', and 'override' is 'global'
        - 'default' is the default setting within VisiData
        - 'global' is a user override on that default that applies globally
        - sheet-specific overrides global and default, for the sheet it is specific to
        - options set through visidatarc and cli are 'global' unless otherwise specified
    - [save] grab `save_foo` from **SheetType** first
        - allows overrides of sheet-specific saving

# v2.1.1 (2021-01-03)

    - [macros] allow macro interfaces to be longnames (thanks @frosencrantz #787)

    - [loaders http] have automatic API pagination (thanks @geekscrapy for feature request #480)
    - [loaders json] improve loading speedup 50% (thanks @lxcode for investigating and pointing this out #765)
        - this makes JSON saving non-deterministic in Python 3.6, as the order of fields output is dependent on the order within the dict
            - (this is the default behaviour for dicts in Python 3.7+)
    - [loaders json] try loading as jsonl before json (inverted)
        - jsonl is a streamable format, so this way it doesn't have to wait for the entire contents to be loaded before failing to parse as json and then trying to parse as jsonl
        - fixes api loading with http so that contents of each response are added as they happen
        - unfurl toplevel lists
        - functionally now jsonl and json are identical
    - [loaders json] try parsing `options.json_indent` as int (thanks @frosencrantz for the bug report #753)
         this means json output can't be indented with a number. this seems like an uncommon use case
    - [loaders json] skip lines starting with `#`
    - [loaders pdf] `options.pdf_tables` to parse tables from pdf with tabular
    - [loaders sqlite] use rowid to update and delete rows

    - [loaders zip] add extract-file, extract-selected, extract-file-to, extract-selected-to commands
    - [macros] add improved macro system (thanks @bob-u for feature request #755)
        - `m` (`macro-record`) begins recording macro; `m` prompts for keystroke, and completes recording
        - macro can then be executed every time provided keystroke is used, will override existing keybinding
        - `gm` opens an index of all existing macros, can be directly viewed with `Enter` and then modified with `Ctrl+S`
        - macros will run command on current row, column sheet
        - remove deprecated `z Ctrl+D` older iteration of macro system
    - [regex] use capture names for column names, if available, in `capture-col` (thanks @tsibley for PR #808)
        - allows for pre-determining friendlier column names, saving a renaming step later
    - [save] `g Ctrl+S` is `save-sheets-selected` on **IndexSheet**
        - new command allows some or all sheets on an **IndexSheet** to be saved (and not the sheets on the sheet stack)
    - [saver] add fixed-width saver (uses col.width)
    - [saver sqlite] ensureLoaded when saving sheets to sqlite db
    - [search] `search-next` and `searchr-next` are now bound to n and N (was `next-search` and `search-prev`)
    - [select] differentiate select-equal- and select-exact- (thanks @geekscrapy for feature request #734)
       - previous select-equal- matched type value
       - now select-equal- matches display value
       - add `z,` and `gz,` bindings for select-exact-cell/-row
    - [sheets] sorting on **SheetsSheet** now does not sort **SheetsSheet** itself. (thanks @klartext and @geekscrapy for bug reports #761 #518)
    - [status] use `color_working` for progress indicator (thanks @geekscrapy for feature request #804)
    - [types] add floatsi parser (sponsored feature by @anjakefala #661)
        - floatsi type now parses SI strings (like 2.3M)
        - use `z%` to set column type to floatsi

## Bugfixes

    - [api] expose visidata.view (thanks @alekibango for bug report #732)

        - thanks @jsvine for name and initial implementation

## Options
    - [cli] custom cli option parsing (thanks @tsibley for the behaviour request #573)
        - `--options` apply as sheet-specific option overrides to the sources following them
        - the last setting for a given option is the cli-given override setting (applies to all cli sources, unless they have the option already set)
        - this allows both
            - `vd -f csv foo.txt`
            - `vd foo.txt -f csv`
        - `--help` opens the manpage
        - `-g` prefix sets option globally for all sheets
    - [cli] add --imports (default "plugins") (thanks @tsibley for feature request #448)

        - plugins can be installed by VisiData without modifying .visidatarc
    - [chooser] experimental `options.fancy_chooser`
        - when fancy_chooser enabled, aggregators and jointype are chosen with a ChoiceSheet.
        - press `ENTER` on any row to choose a single option, or select some rows, and press `ENTER` to choose the selectedrows
        - warning: the mechanism to do this effectively launches another instance of visidata, and so it is possible to get into an embedded state (if you jump around sheets, for example, instead of selecting). 'gq' should still work (thought `CTRL+Q` may need to be pressed several times).
    - [dir] add `-r` alias for `--dir-recurse`
    - [join-cols] add `options.value_joiner` to combine cell values for join-col (thanks @aborruso for feature request #550)
    - [join-cols] add `options.name_joiner` to combine column names for join-col, and sheet names for dive-row (thanks @aborruso for feature request #550)
        - sheet names for join-sheets are still joined with '+' or '&' for the time being
    - [loaders html] add `options.html_title` to exclude the sheetname when saving sheet as html table (thanks @geekscrapy for PR #566)
    - [loaders postgres] add support for custom postgres schema (Thanks @p3k for PR #615)

    - [loaders zip] -f filetype now applies to inner files
    - [mouse] add options.mouse_interval to control the max time between press/release for click (ms)
        - set to 0 to disable completely
    - [pyobj] add `options.expand_col_scanrows` to set the number of rows to check when expanding columns (0 = all)
    - [type fmtstr] add fmtstr options for numerical types
        - add options.disp_currency_fmt
        - add options.disp_int_fmt

    - [loaders csv] PEP 479 fix for csv loader (thanks @ajkerrigan for PR #499)
        - This avoids the following error when opening CSV files in Python 3.8: `RuntimeError: generator raised StopIteration`, but maintains the behaviour of gracefully handling malformed CSV files.
