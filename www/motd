A good workman is known by his tools.
Have you taken the visidata.org/survey?
Live in a world of your own, but always welcome visitors.
Look afar and see the end from the beginning.
Make a wish, it might come true.
Reply hazy, ask again later.
Someone is speaking well of you.
Stay away from hurricanes for a while.
The time is right to make new friends.
Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.
Today is what happened to yesterday.
What happened last night can happen again.
Do ya feel lucky, textpunk?
Don't panic.
What we think, we become.
Success is a poor teacher.
Forever is composed of nows.
There is no place like home.
