# Feature Roadmap

A loose plan that is subject to change.

## v1.0
- improve colorizer interface
- Python expressions should be usable like regex for search, select, etc
- documented Python3 API for vd.py use by other scripts

## Future
- delete regex match in cells
- maintain original ordering with implicit/hidden line# column
- freqtbl: make bins from continuous data
- popup windows for enum selection
- save as .json
- simple file management in VSheetDir:
  - rename with 'e'dit
  - mass rename with transform
  - ^Delete
  - only apply changes with ^S
- checkpoint data for faster replay/undo
- connect to larger datasets (via blaze?)
- load new .py plugins for inputs/outputs/sheets
   - git app that can streamline standard workflows
     - checkout branch or revision with TUI interface
     - browse through history
- load larger than memory .csv/tsv files
- fixed-column detector
- '.' repeat command
- save all sheets to .h5 file
- reload derived sheets
- html table parsing into columns
- parse .xml
- better csv/tsv sniffer
- how to handle timezone for datetime
