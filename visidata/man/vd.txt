NAME
     VisiData — a terminal utility for exploring and arranging tabular data

SYNOPSIS
     vd [options] [input ...]
     visidata [options] [input ...]
     vd [options] --play cmdlog [-w waitsecs] [--batch] [-i] [-o output]
        [field=value]
     vd [options] [input ...] +toplevel:subsheet:row:col

DESCRIPTION
     VisiData is an easy-to-use multipurpose tool to explore, clean, edit, and
     restructure data. Rows can be selected, filtered, and grouped; columns
     can be rearranged, transformed, and derived via regex or Python expres‐
     sions; and workflows can be saved, documented, and replayed.

   REPLAY MODE
     -p, --play=cmdlog       replay a saved cmdlog within the interface
     -w, --replay-wait=seconds
                             wait seconds between commands
     -b, --batch             replay in batch mode (with no interface)
     -i, --interactive       launch VisiData in interactive mode after batch
     -o, --output=file       save final visible sheet to file as .tsv
     field=value             replace "{field}" in cmdlog contents with value

      gs  gt  gu      select/toggle/unselect all rows
      zs  zt  zu      select/toggle/unselect all rows from top to cursor
     gzs gzt gzu      select/toggle/unselect all rows from cursor to bottom
      |   \ regex     select/unselect rows matching regex in current column
     g|  g\ regex     select/unselect rows matching regex in any visible
                      column
     z|  z\ expr      select/unselect rows matching Python expr in any visible
                      column
      , (comma)       select rows matching display value of current cell in
                      current column
     g,               select rows matching display value of current row in all
                      visible columns
     z, gz,           select rows matching typed value of current cell/row in
                      current column/all visible columns

   Row Sorting/Filtering
       [    ]         sort ascending/descending by current column; replace any
                      existing sort criteria
      g[   g]         sort ascending/descending by all key columns; replace
                      any existing sort criteria
      z[   z]         sort ascending/descending by current column; add to ex‐
                      isting sort criteria
     gz[  gz]         sort ascending/descending by all key columns; add to ex‐
                      isting sort criteria
      "               open duplicate sheet with only selected rows
     g"               open duplicate sheet with all rows
     gz"              open duplicate sheet with deepcopy of selected rows

     The rows in these duplicated sheets (except deepcopy) are references to
     rows on the original source sheets, and so edits to the filtered rows
     will naturally be reflected in the original rows.  Use g' to freeze sheet
     contents in a deliberate copy.

                      Note: if the format does not support multisave, or the
                      filename ends in a /, a directory will be created.
     z^S filename     save current column only to filename in format
                      determined by extension (default .tsv)
     ^D filename.vdj  save CommandLog to filename.vdj file

                      nBefore rows, and nAfter rows

   Data Visualization
      . (dot)       plot current numeric column vs key columns. The numeric
                    key column is used for the x-axis; categorical key column
                    values determine color.
     g.             plot a graph of all visible numeric columns vs key
                    columns.

     If rows on the current sheet represent plottable coordinates (as in .shp
     or vector .mbtiles sources),  . plots the current row, and g. plots all
     selected rows (or all rows if none selected).

           vd -P open-plugins
     preplay longname open-plugins before starting the session

FILES
     At the start of every session, VisiData looks for $HOME/.visidatarc, and
     calls Python exec() on its contents if it exists. For example:

        options.min_memory_mb=100  # stop processing without 100MB free

        bindkey('0', 'go-leftmost')   # alias '0' to go to first column, like vim

        def median(values):
            L = sorted(values)
            return L[len(L)//2]

        vd.aggregator('median', median)

     Functions defined in .visidatarc are available in python expressions
     (e.g. in derived columns).

SUPPORTED SOURCES
     Core VisiData includes these sources:

        tsv (tab-separated value)
           Plain and simple. VisiData writes tsv format by default. See the
           --tsv-delimiter option.

        csv (comma-separated value)
           .csv files are a scourge upon the earth, and still regrettably
           common.
           See the --csv-dialect, --csv-delimiter, --csv-quotechar, and
           --csv-skipinitialspace options.
           Accepted dialects are excel-tab, unix, and excel.

        fixed (fixed width text)
           Columns are autodetected from the first 1000 rows (adjustable with
           --fixed-rows).

        json (single object) and jsonl/ndjson/ldjson (one object per line).
           Cells containing lists (e.g. [3]) or dicts ({3}) can be expanded
           into new columns with ( and unexpanded with ).

        sqlite
           May include multiple tables. The initial sheet is the table
           directory; Enter loads the entire table into memory. z^S saves
           modifications to source.

     URL schemes are also supported:
        http (requires requests); can be used as transport for with another
        filetype

     For a list of all remaining formats supported by VisiData, see
     https://visidata.org/formats.

     In addition, .zip, .gz, .bz2, .xz, ,zstd, and .zst files are decompressed
     on the fly.
