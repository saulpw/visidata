This sheet represents the top level of {sheet.source.name}.{sheet.source.ext}.

Each cell within this sheet can contain dictionaries (representing TOML key:value pairs), lists (representing TOML arrays), or scalars.

Some helpful commands when working with cells of lists and dictionaries:

- `(` (`expand-col`) on a column with lists or dictionaries will "expand" the structures in the cells into new columns within the current sheet.
- `zEnter` on a cell with lists or dictionaries will "dive" into the current cell, expanding its structures into rows and columns in a seperate sheet.
