# How to find commands

## Command Palette

- {help.commands.exec_longname}

Start typing a command longname or keyword in its helpstring.

- [:code]Enter[/] to execute top command.
- [:code]Tab[/] to highlight top command and provide a numeric jumplist.

When a command is highlighted:

- [:code]Tab[/]/[:code]Shift+Tab[/] to cycle highlighted command.
- [:code]Enter[/] to execute highlighted command.
- [:code]0-9[/] to execute numbered command.

## Command Sheet

The Command Sheet lists all of the available commands, their keyboard bindings, function names, and other information.

- {help.commands.help_commands_all}
- {help.commands.help_commands}

'description' and 'longname' column: useful to find rows that share a longname suffix or prefix. E.g, `save` or `selected`.

'keystrokes' and 'all_bindings' column: useful to search for keybindings. E.g, `Ctrl` or `F`.
