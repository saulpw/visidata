# The Command Sheet: How to find the command you want run

The Command Sheet lists all of the available commands, their keyboard bindings, function names and other information.

## Use the fuzzy finder to search by name

- {help.commands.exec_longname}

Press [:keys]Tab[/] to provide a numeric jumplist. Typing the number next to a command will execute the command.

## Open the Command Sheet for all commands

- {help.commands.help_commands_all}


## Open the Command Sheet for the current sheet

- {help.commands.help_commands}

## Search for commands

Just like any other sheet, use search and select on the Comand Sheet. The `description` and `longname` columns are helpful.

- {help.commands.search_col}
- {help.commands.search_cols}  

- {help.commands.search_next}  
- {help.commands.searchr_next}  

To create a new sheet with only related commands, select rows that match some part of the command, for example, `save`:

- {help.commands.select_cols_regex} to find and highlight commands containing a pattern
- open these rows as a new sheet with [:keys]"[/]

## Look up keybindings

Using the `keystrokes` and/or the `all_bindings` column, search for a key binding. For example, search for 'Ctrl' to find all keybindings that use the 'Ctrl' key.
