# Matching And Transforming Strings With Regexes

Visidata has built-in support for using Regular Expressions as input for some commands. This includes many commands that enable you to search and transform your data using these patterns.

## Select Rows

- {help.commands.select-col-regex}
- {help.commands.select-cols-regex}

- {help.commands.unselect-col-regex}

## Search
