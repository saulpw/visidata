# Resize, hide, and rename columns

## Resize the current column

- {help.commands.resize_col_max}
- {help.commands.resize_col_input}
- {help.commands.resize_col_half}

## Resize multiple columns

- {help.commands.resize_cols_input}

## Hide and Unhide columns

Clean up the sheet by hiding unwanted columns.  Hidden columns are still present, but not visible in the main set of columns.
(They are minimized on the right side and can be unhidden with {help.commands.resize_col_max}.

- {help.commands.hide_col}
- {help.commands.unhide_cols}

Use {help.commands.columns_sheet} to control visibility as well.

## Rename columns

- {help.commands.rename_col}

## Rename one or more columns using data 

Rename one or more columns using data from the sheet:

- {help.commands.rename_col_selected}
- {help.commands.rename_cols_row}
- {help.commands.rename_cols_selected}

## Clean column names

Rename columns to be valid Python identifiers that can be used in column
expressions.

- {help.commands.normalize_col_names}
- {help.commands.clean_names}

## Change row height

Sometimes the data for a cell will not fit within the current width. If the
data is large, or spans multiple lines, change the row height to show more for
the current column width. Row height adjustments can also be combined with
column width changes.

- {help.commands.toggle_multiline}
- {help.commands.resize_height_input}
- {help.commands.resize_height_max}
