# Rename, hide and resize columns

How to rename, hide, and resize columns to focus on key data. These actions
help organize the sheet, making it easier to prioritize information
and reduce distractions. 

# Renaming columns

- {help.commands.rename_col}

## Renaming one or more columns using data 

Rename one or more columns using data from the sheet:

- {help.commands.rename_col_selected}
- {help.commands.rename_cols_row}
- {help.commands.rename_cols_selected}

## Clean column names

Rename columns to be valid python identifiers that can be used in column
expressions.

- {help.commands.normalize_col_names}
- {help.commands.clean_names}

# Hiding and Unhiding columns

Clean up the sheet by hiding unwanted columns.  Hidden columns are still present, just not visible.

- {help.commands.hide_col}. 
- {help.commands.unhide_cols}

Use the {help.commands.columns_sheet} to control visibility as well.

# Resizing columns

## Resize the current column

- {help.commands.resize_col_max}
- {help.commands.resize_col_input}
- {help.commands.resize_col_half}

## Resize multiple columns

- {help.commands.resize_cols_input}

# Changing row height

Sometimes the data for a cell will not fit within the current width. If the
data is large, or spans multiple lines, change the row height to show more for
the current column width. Row height adjustments can also be combined with
column width changes.

- {help.commands.toggle_multiline}
- {help.commands.resize_height_input}
- {help.commands.resize_height_max}
