# The Menu System

Located at the very top of the screen, the menu organizes many commands within submenu trees.

Navigate the menu like a GUI by using the mouse to click on menu items.

To navigate with the keyboard, `Alt+H` will open the **Help** menu, and from there use the arrow keys to move between submenus.

Additionally, each top-level menu name has a single letter underlined. `Alt+<underlined letter>` will open that menu. For example, `Alt+F` will open the **File** menu.

To open a submenu (indicated by `{vd.options.disp_menu_more}`) press the `â†’` key or click on it with the mouse. Each non-submenu item is a command.

The menu shows the description of the current command, along with the command name and its keyboard shortcut (if available). Execute the current command by clicking on it or pressing `Enter`.

Some other indicators:

- `{vd.options.disp_menu_push}`: the command opens another sheet.
- `{vd.options.disp_menu_input}`: the command requires input.

Some commands are only available on a specific sheet type, and appear [:color_menu_spec]highlighted[/] in the menu when the current sheet is that type. If the command is not available, it will not appear at all.

## Options
