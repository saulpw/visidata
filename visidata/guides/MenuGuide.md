# The Menu System

The menu (on the first row of the window) contains most commands, organized within a tree of submenus.

Click on menu items to navigate the menu like a GUI.

With the keyboard:

- {help.commands.menu_help}
- [:keys]Arrow[/] keys to move between submenus

Additionally, each top-level menu name has a single letter underlined. [:keys]Alt+<underlined letter>[/] to open that menu. For example, [:keys]Alt+F[/] to open the **File** menu.

Each non-submenu item is a command. It shows the description of the current command, along with the command name and its keyboard shortcut (if available). Click on the item or [:keys]Enter[/] to execute it.

Indicators:

- {help.options.disp_menu_more}
- {help.options.disp_menu_push}
- {help.options.disp_menu_input}

Some commands are only available on a specific sheet type, and appear [:color_menu_spec]highlighted[/] in the menu when the current sheet is that type. If the command is not available, it will not appear at all.

## Options

- {help.options.disp_menu}
