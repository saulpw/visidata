# VisiData Documentation

## How the documentation is organised

Inspired by [Daniele Procida](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/), the documentation is structured into the following categories:
* Tutorials take you on a guided tour of features in VisiData. This is the recommended place to start if you are new.
* Reference guides contain a comprehensive overview of all out-of-box available commands and options.
* How-to guides are recipes. They will guide you through the steps of common workflows in VisiData.
* [The VisiData book]() is a high-level overview of fundamental concepts and provides background information on VisiData design decisions.
