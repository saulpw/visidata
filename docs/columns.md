## How to manipulate columns

Commands(s)     Operation
------------    -----------
`!`             pins the current column on the left as a key column
 `H`  `L`       slides the current column **one position** to the left/right
`gH` `gL`       slides the current column **all the way** to the left/right of the sheet

## How to hide (remove) and unhide (return) columns

###### How to hide columns

- Press `-` (hyphen) to hide the current column.

**or**

1. Press `C` on the source sheet to open its **Columns sheet**.
2. Move the cursor right to the **width** column.
3. Move the cursor down to the row which represents the column you wish to hide.
4. Press `e` followed by `0` to set the width for that column to **0**.
5. Press `q` to return to the source sheet.

###### How to unhide columns

1. Press `C` on the source sheet to open its **Columns sheet**.
2. Move the cursor right to the **width** column.
3. Move the cursor down to the row which represents the column you wish to unhide. Currently, that cell should contain the value **0**.
4. Press `e` followed by a *positive number* to set the width.
5. Press `q` to return to the source sheet.

## How to specify column types

Command    Type
--------- --------
` ~`      string
` #`      int
` %`      float
` $`      currency
` @`      date
`z#`      vlen
`z~`      anytype

Columns usually begin as untyped. Odd results while working with numerical or datetime data is usually due to values being considered as strings, and the problem is solved by setting the correct type.

The following example uses the file [sample.tsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saulpw/visidata/stable/sample_data/sample.tsv).

<div class="asciicast">
    <asciinema-player id="player-types" poster="npt:0:20" rows=27 src="../casts/types.cast"></asciinema-player>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/asciinema-player.js"></script>
</div>

###### How to batch specify column types for more than one column

1. Press `C` to open the **Columns sheet**.
2. Press `s` or `t` to select the rows referencing the columns you wish to type.
3. Type `g` followed by the any of the above typing keystrokes to set the type for all selected columns on the source sheet.

## How to format columns

**Note**: Un-typed file formats, like tsvs and csvs, will save as they are displayed.

Some types have an option for their default display formatting.

Type      Option            Default
--------- ----------------  --------
int       disp_int_fmt      {:.0f}
float     disp_float_fmt    {:.02f}
currency  disp_currency_fmt %0.2f
date      disp_date_fmt     %Y-%m-%d

Ways to adjust the display formatting:
* The `fmtstr` column on the **Columns Sheet** allows you to specify the formatting for specific columns within that session, without affecting the default for the others.
* The `disp_TYPE_fmt` option can be changed on the **Options Sheet** to set the formatting for all columns of type `TYPE` in that session.
* The `--disp-TYPE-fmt` argument can be passed through the commandline to set the formatting for all columns of type `TYPE` in that session.
* The `options.disp_TYPE_fmt` can be set in the `~/.visidatarc` to change the default formatting for all columns of type `TYPE` for all sessions.

There are several formatting styles offered:
* Formatting that starts with `'%'` (e.g. *%0.2f*) will use [locale.format_string()](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/locale.html#locale.format_string).
* Otherwise (e.g. *{:.02f}*), formatting will be passed to Python's [string.format()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#custom-string-formatting).
* Date fmtstr are passed to [strftime](https://strftime.org/).

The default for currency uses `locale.format_string()`. The default for int/float/date use `string.format()`.

###### How to format a specific numeric columns to contain a thousands separator within a session?

1. Set a column to a numeric type by pressing `#` (int), `%` (float), or `$` (currency).
2. Press `C` to open the **Columns Sheet**.
3. Move to the row referencing the column whose display you wish to format. Move the cursor to the fmtstr column.
4. Type `e` followed by *{:,.0f}* for an `int` type and *{:,.02f}* for a floating point type.

###### How to set all date columns to be **month/day/year**.

The default can be set in a `~/.visidatarc`.

~~~
options.disp_date_fmt = '%m/%d/%Y'
~~~

or passed through the commandline

~~~
vd --disp-date-fmt='%m/%d/%Y'
~~~

or set in the **Options Sheet**.

1. Press `O` to open the **Options Sheet**.
2. Move the cursor down to the relevant *disp_date_fmt* option.
3. Type `e` followed by *%m/%d/%Y*.

## How to split a column

Python regular expressions provide more finetuned column splitting. The following example
uses the commands for column splitting and transformation with [xd/puzzles.tsv](http://xd.saul.pw/xd-metadata.zip).

<div class="asciicast">
    <asciinema-player id="player-split-regex" poster="npt:0:20" rows=27 src="../casts/split-regex.cast"></asciinema-player>
</div>

###

- `:` adds new columns derived from splitting the current column at positions defined by a *regex pattern*. The current row will be used to infer the number of columns that will be created.
- `;` adds new columns derived from pulling the contents of the current column which match the *regex within capture groups*. This command also requires an example row.
- `*` followed by *regex*`/`*substring* replaces the text which matches the capture groups in *regex* with the contents of *substring*. *substring* may include backreferences (*\1* etc).

## [How to expand columns that contain nested data](#expand) {#expand}

If a column includes container data such as JSON objects or arrays, the `(` family of commands can expand the child values into top-level columns:

Command       Operation
---------     --------
`  (`         expand _current_ column
` g(`         expand _all visible_ columns fully
` z(`         expand _current_ column to a specific depth (prompt for input)
`gz(`         expand _all visible_ columns to a specific depth (prompt for input)
`  )`         contract (unexpand) the current column

The following demo shows `(` commands applied to this data:

~~~
[
    [ "short", "array" ],
    [ "slightly", "longer", "array" ],
    { "nested": "data" },
    { "more": { "deeply": { "nested": "data" } } }
]
~~~

<div class="asciicast">
    <asciinema-player id="player-expand-cols" poster="npt:0:20" rows=13 src="../casts/expand-cols.cast"></asciinema-player>
</div>

Note that by default the expansion logic will look for nested columns in **up to 1,000 rows surrounding the cursor**. This behavior can be controlled by adjusting `expand_col_scanrows` in the **Options Sheet**, or setting `options.expand_col_scanrows` in the `~/.visidatarc` file.

## [How to create derivative columns](#derived) {#derived}

The `=` command takes a Python expression as input, evaluates the expression, and creates a new column from the result. Column names can be supplied as variables, in order to have the expression performed on the column cell-by-cell. VisiData supports `Tab` autocompletion of column names.

The following examples use the file [sample.tsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saulpw/visidata/stable/sample_data/sample.tsv).

**Question** On which days have we sold more than 10 **Item**s?

1. Scroll to the **Units** column. Set the type of the **Units** column by pressing `#` (int).
2. Type `=` followed by `Units > 10`. A new column will be created. The cells in this column will contain the value **True** in rows where the number of **Units** are greater than 10 and **False** otherwise.
3. Move to the new derived column.
4. Type `|` followed by `True` to select all rows where there were more than 10 **Units** sold.
5. Press `"` to open a duplicate sheet with only those selected rows.

**Question** I have a dateset with separate columns for **Year**, **Month** and **Day**. How can I concatenate them into a single date column?

1. Type `=` followed by `Year + '-' + Month + '-' + Day`.
2. Set the type of the new derived column by pressing `@` (date).
3. Type `^` followed by `Date` to rename the column to **Date**.

## How to configure multiple columns

Properties of columns on the source sheet can be changed by using [standard editing commands](/man#edit) on its **Columns sheet** (accessed with `C`). In particular, it facilitates the selection of multiple columns, followed by utilising one of the `g`-prefixed commands to modify all of them.

For a full list of available commands, see the [man page](/man#columns). Some example workflows follow.

The following examples use the file [sample.tsv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saulpw/visidata/stable/sample_data/sample.tsv).

###### How to set multiple statistical aggregators

**Question** What is the average daily revenue from sales of each **Item**?

1. Set the type of the **Units** column by pressing `#` (int).
2. Set the type of the **Total** column by pressing `%` (float).
3. Press `C` to open the **Columns sheet**.
4. Press `s` or `t` on the rows referencing the source sheet **Units** column and the **Total** column to select them.
5. Type `g+` followed by `avg` to add a **avg** statistical aggregator to the selected rows.
6. Press `q` to exit and return to the source sheet.
7. Scroll to the **Item** column. Press `F` to open the **Frequency table**.

**Question** What are the daily average and sum total number of **Units** sold for each **Item**?

1. Press `C` to open the **Columns sheet**.
2. Move the cursor to the row referencing the source sheet **Units** column.

    a. Press `s` or `t` to select it.
    b. Set the type for the source sheet **Units** columns by pressing `g#` (int).
    c. Move the cursor to the **aggregators** column.
    d. Type `e` to enter edit mode, followed by *sum avg*.

3. Press `q` to exit and return to the source sheet.
4. Move the cursor to the **Item** column. Press `F` to open the **Frequency table**.
