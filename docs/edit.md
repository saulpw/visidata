## How to edit cells

For a summary of all editing commands, see the [man page](/man#edit).

Command                    Operation
--------                   ----------
 `e`                       edit contents of **current cell**
`ge` *text*                set contents of **current column for selected rows** to *text*
`g*` *regex*/*subst*       replace matching *regex* in **current column for selected rows** with *subst*
`g=` *expr*                evaluate Python *expr* over each selected row and set **current column** to the result

While in editing mode, or anytime VisiData expects input (with e.g. `=`, `;`), typical readline commands become available:

Command             Operation
--------            ----------
`Enter`             accepts input
`Ctrl+C`/`Esc`      aborts input
`Ctrl+O`            opens external $EDITOR to edit contents
`Ctrl+R`            reloads initial value
`Ctrl+A`/`Ctrl+E`   moves to beginning/end of line
`Backspace`         deletes previous character
`Up`/`Down`         sets contents to previous/next in history
`Tab`/`Shift-Tab`   autocompletes input (when available)

## How to rename columns

Command     Operation
--------    ----------
  `^`       edits name of **current** column
 `g^`       sets names of **all unnamed visible** columns to contents of **selected** rows (or **current** row)
 `z^`       sets name of **current** column to contents of **current** cell
`gz^`       sets name of **current** column to combined contents of **current** column for **selected** rows

In most cases, `^` is the preferred command. Examples which demo `^` can be seen in [Columns](/docs/columns#derived) and [Group](/docs/group#frequency).

###### How to set the header in an Excel sheet?

For most filetypes (e.g. csv, tsv, xls(x)) the loaders assume that the dataset's first `options.header` rows contain the column names.

If the Excel file has multiple sheets with varying number of header rows:

1. Pass `--header=0` while loading the file.

~~~
vd file.xlsx --header=0
~~~

2. For each sheet, press `s` or `t` to select the rows which represent the header rows.
3. Press `g^` to set the names of the headers to the contents of selected rows.

###### How to rename headers using the Columns sheet

1. Press `Shift+C` to open the **Columns sheet**.
2. Within the **name** column, move the cursor to the row which represents the source sheet.
3. Type `e` and then input *the new column name*. Press `Enter`.
4. Press `q` to return to the source sheet and see the renamed column.
