Hello Loader
------------

The most basic loader reads in a text file:

Step 1. ``open_`` filetype boilerplate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    def open_readme(p):
        return ReadmeSheet(p.name, source=p)

This is used for filetype ``readme``, which is used for files with
extension ``.readme``, or when specified manually with the ``filetype``
option.

The ``open_<filetype>`` function almost always looks exactly like this,
with only the type of Sheet changed. Of course, an existing `sheet
type <>`__ can be used.

``p`` is a ```visidata.Path`` <>`__.

The actual loading happens in the Sheet:

Step 2. Create a Sheet subclass
-------------------------------

::

    class ReadmeSheet(TableSheet):
        rowtype = 'lines'   # rowdef: [str]

-  TableSheet (also just ``Sheet``) is the basic tabular sheet of rows
   and columns. Most loader sheets will inherit from TableSheet, but
   some might inherit from more specialized sheets if they share
   functionality, or from ``BaseSheet`` if they are not tabular (like
   the ``Canvas``).

-  The ``rowtype`` member is only displayed on the `right-hand
   status <>`__. It should be **plural**. If not given, it is
   "``rows``". It's helpful to give the user an subconscious check of
   the kind of sheet being shown.

-  The ``rowdef`` should be given for all loaders, even though it is
   only a comment. It specifies the expected Pythonic structure of the
   rows on this sheet. This is important because nearly every other
   component of the sheet depends on this structure.

Step 2. Load data into rows, and yield them one-by-one
------------------------------------------------------

``reload()`` is called when the Sheet is first pushed, and thereafter by
the user with ``^R``. The default ``TableSheet.reload()`` iterates
through the rows returned by ``iterload``, and takes care of a few
common commonalities (like running async and resetting the ``rows``
member), Each loader then defines an ``iterload``, which uses the Sheet
``source`` to populate and then yield each row one-by-one.

::

    class ReadmeSheet(TableSheet):
        rowtype = 'lines'   # rowdef: [str]

        def iterload(self):
            for line in self.source:
                yield [line]

-  ``str`` is not actually a valid rowdef.
-  Each row must have a unique ``rowid``, which by default is the Python
   ``id()`` of the row. Because Python interns common strings, strings
   with the same value will have the same rowid. This breaks a lot of
   features.
-  Also, as an immutable type, it would be annoyingly uneditable.
-  So it's wrapped it in a Python ``list``, which is guaranteed to be
   mutable and unique.

-  ``source`` is a Path; the same as the source kwarg given in
   ``open_readme``. In fact, any kwarg passed to a Sheet constructor
   will be stored on the sheet in a member of the same name.

-  ```visidata.Path`` <#visidata.path>`__ objects are Path-like but have
   some additional features, like being iterable (yielding their
   contents one line at a time).
-  This case is optimized to read the file a small amount at a time. Do
   **not** use e.g. ``for line in p.read().splitlines()``, as that will
   read the entire file before returning the first line. Always consider
   if your code will work well with 1GB of data. Ideally test with a
   too-large amount of data to make sure it degrades gracefully.

-  If the loader requires a third-party library, import it inside
   iterload() or reload() (or ``open_`` if necessary). Do not import at
   the toplevel or ``vd`` will fail to start if the library is not
   installed.

By default, a Sheet has one Column which just displays a string
representation of the row. So the above example is a good starting point
for any loader; just get the rows however they come most easily from the
source, and launch vd with a sample dataset. Then use ``Ctrl+Y`` to
explore the row as a Python object to find what properties you want to
see.

reload()
~~~~~~~~

For more control over the whole loading process, BaseSheet.reload() can
be overridden instead of using iterload():

::

        @asyncthread
        def reload(self):
            self.rows = []
            for line in self.source:
                self.addRow([line])

-  ``@asyncthread`` launches the decorated function in its own thread.
-  ``rows`` must be reset to a new object. **Never call
   ``rows.clear()``**.
-  Always add rows using ```addRow()`` <>`__.

Supporting asynchronous loaders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Large enough datasets will cause the interface to freeze. Fortunately,
the stock ``reload`` and the ``iterload`` structure results in an
`async </docs/async>`__ loader on default. Since rows are yielded **one
at a time**, they become available as they are loaded, and ``reload``
itself is decorated with an ``@asyncthread``, which causes it to be
launched in a new thread.

Further things to take into account: - All row iterators should be
wrapped with ```Progress`` </docs/async#Progress>`__. This updates the
**progress percentage** as it passes each element through. - Do not
depend on the order of ``rows`` after they are added; e.g. do not
reference ``rows[-1]``. The order of rows may change during an
asynchronous loader. - Catch any ``Exception``\ s that might be raised
while handling a specific row, and add them as the row instead. If
``Exception`` handling is missing within iterload, rows will stop
loading upon hitting an ``Exception``. Never use a bare ``except:``
clause or the loader thread will not be cancelable with ``Ctrl+C``.

Progress and Exception example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

        class FooSheet(Sheet):
            ...
            def iterload(self):
                for bar in Progress(foolib.iterfoo(self.source.open_text())):
                    try:
                        r = foolib.parse(bar)
                    except Exception as e:
                        r = e
                    yield r

Test the loader with a large dataset to make sure that:

-  the first rows appear immediately;
-  the progress percentage is being updated;
-  the loader can be cancelled (with ``Ctrl+C``).

3. Enumerate the Columns
------------------------

Each sheet has a unique list of ``columns``. Each ``Column`` provides a
different view into the row.

::

        class FooSheet(Sheet):
            rowtype = 'foobits'  # rowdef: foolib.Bar object

            columns = [
                ColumnAttr('name'),  # foolib.Bar.name
                Column('bar', getter=lambda col,row: row.inside[2],
                              setter=lambda col,row,val: row.set_bar(val)),
                Column('baz', type=int, getter=lambda col,row: row.inside[1]*100)
            ]

In general, set ``columns`` as a class member containing a list of
static columns. If the columns aren't known until data is loaded,
reload/iterload can add new columns using ```addColumn()`` <>`__.

A few snippets:

-  columns from a list of names:
   ``[ColumnItem(name, i) for i, name in enumerate(colnames)]``
-  columns from the first row, when rows are dicts:
   ``[ColumnItem(k) for k in self.rows[0]]``

Column properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Columns have a few properties, all except ``name`` are **optional**
arguments to the constructor:

-  **``name``**: should be a valid Python identifier and unique among
   the column names on the sheet. (Otherwise the column cannot be used
   in an expression.)

-  **``type``**: can be ``str``, ``int``, ``float``, ``date``, or
   ``currency``. By default it is ``anytype``, which passes the original
   value through unmodified.

-  **``width``**: the initial width for the column. ``0`` means hidden;
   ``None`` (default) means calculate on first draw.

Column getters can be any function, but many loaders for are satisfied
with a static list of ItemColumn (for a value in dict and list rowdefs)
and/or AttrColumn (for a member or property directly on the row object).
This is dependent on the loader function; some loaders may prefer to do
less parsing to load faster, and then the Columns need to be
correspondingly more complicated.

See the `Columns section <>`__ for a complete API.

Passthrough options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Loaders which use a Python library (internal or external) are encouraged
to pass all options to it through the ``options("foo_")``. For modules
like csv which expose them as kwargs to some function or constructor,
this is very easy:

::

        rdr = csv.reader(fp, **csvoptions())

Full Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This would be a completely functional read-only viewer for the fictional
foolib. For a more realistic example, see the `annotated
viewtsv </docs/viewtsv>`__ or any of the `included
loaders <https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/tree/stable/visidata/loaders>`__.

::

        from visidata import *

        vd.option('foo_scale', 100, 'amount to scale baz')


        class FooSheet(Sheet):
            rowtype = 'foobits'  # rowdef: foolib.Bar object
            columns = [
                ColumnAttr('name'),  # foolib.Bar.name
                Column('bar', getter=lambda col,row: row.inside[2],
                              setter=lambda col,row,val: row.set_bar(val)),
                Column('baz', type=int, getter=lambda col,row: row.inside[1]*options.foo_scale)
            ]

            def iterload(self):
                import foolib

                for bar in Progress(foolib.iterfoo(self.source.open_text())):
                    try:
                        r = foolib.parse(bar, **options.getall('foo_'))
                    except Exception as e:
                        r = e
                    yield r


        FooSheet.addCommand(ALT+'b', 'reset-bar', 'cursorRow.set_bar(0)')

Savers
------

A full-duplex loader requires a **saver**. The saver iterates over all
``rows`` and ``visibleCols``, calling ``getValue``, ``getDisplayValue``
or ``getTypedValue``, and saves the results in the format of that
filetype. Savers should be decorated with ``@VisiData.api`` in order to
make them available through the ``vd`` object's scope.

::

        @VisiData.api
        def save_foo(vd, path, *sheets):
            with path.open_text(mode='w') as fp:
                for i, row in enumerate(Progress(sheet.rows)):
                    for col in sheet.visibleCols:
                        foolib.write(fp, i, col.name, col.getValue(row))

-  ``path`` is a ``visidata.Path()`` object representing the file being
   written to
-  ``*sheets`` is a list of 1 or more sheets to be saved

The saver should preserve the column names and translate their types
into foolib semantics, but other attributes on the Columns should
generally not be saved.

Building a loader for a URL schemetype
--------------------------------------

When VisiData tries to open a URL with schemetype of ``foo`` (i.e.
starting with ``foo://``), it calls ``openurl_foo(urlpath, filetype)``.
``urlpath`` is a ``UrlPath`` object, with attributes for each of the
elements of the parsed URL.

``openurl_foo`` should return a Sheet or call ``error()``. If the URL
indicates a particular type of Sheet (like ``magnet://``), then it
should construct that Sheet itself. If the URL is just a means to get to
another filetype, then it can call ``openSource`` with a Path-like
object that knows how to fetch the URL:

::

        def openurl_foo(p, filetype=None):
            return openSource(FooPath(p.url), filetype=filetype)

``visidata.Path``
=================

-  ``Path.given``
-  ``Path.stat()``
-  ``Path.exists()``
-  ``Path.open_text()``
-  ``Path.read_text()``
-  ``Path.open_bytes()``
-  ``Path.read_bytes()``
-  ``Path.open()``
-  ``Path.is_url()``
-  ``Path.scheme``
-  ``Path.with_name()``
