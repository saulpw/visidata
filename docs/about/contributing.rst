============

VisiData was created by Saul Pwanson ``<vd@saul.pw>``.

VisiData needs lots of usage and testing to help it become useful and
reliable. If you are actively using VisiData, please let me know! Maybe
there is an easy way to improve the tool for both of us.

Also please create a GitHub issue if anything doesn't appear to be
working right. If you get an unexpected error, please include the full
stack trace that you get with ``Ctrl-e``.

Branch structure
