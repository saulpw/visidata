VisiData was created by Saul Pwanson `<vd@saul.pw>`.

VisiData is currently under active development (as of January 2017).

VisiData needs lots of usage and testing to help it become useful and dependable.  If you are actively using VisiData, please let me know!  Maybe there is an easy way to improve the tool for both of us.

Also please create a GitHub issue if anything doesn't appear to be working right.
If you get an unexpected error (on the status line), please include the full stack trace that you get with `^E`.

Please contact me at the email address above if you would like to contribute in some other way.
