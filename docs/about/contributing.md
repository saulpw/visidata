## Contributing

VisiData was created by Saul Pwanson `<vd@saul.pw>`.

VisiData needs lots of usage and testing to help it become useful and reliable.
If you are actively using VisiData, please let me know!
Maybe there is an easy way to improve the tool for both of us.

Also please create a GitHub issue if anything doesn't appear to be working right.
If you get an unexpected error, please include the full stack trace that you get with `^E`.
