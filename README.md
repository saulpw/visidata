# VisiData v0.80 [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/saulpw/visidata/tree/stable.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/saulpw/visidata/tree/stable)

A curses interface for exploring and arranging tabular data

Usable via any remote shell which has Python3 installed.

A few interesting commands:

* `Shift-F` pushes a frequency analysis of the current column
* `=` creates a new column from the given Python expression (use column names to refer to their contents)
* `.` creates new columns from the match groups of the given regex

# Getting Started

## Install VisiData

### from pypi (`stable` branch)

```
$ pip3 install visidata
```

### or clone from git

```
$ git clone http://github.com/saulpw/visidata.git
$ cd visidata
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py install
```

### Dependencies

- Python 3.3+
- h5py and numpy (if opening .hdf5 files)

**Remember to install the Python3 versions of these packages with e.g. `pip3`**

## Run VisiData

If installed via pip3, `vd` should launch without issue.

```
$ vd [<options>] [<inputs> ...]
```

If no inputs are given, `vd` opens the current directory.
Unknown filetypes are by default viewed with a text browser.

If installed via `git clone`, first set up some environment variables (on terminal):

```
$ export PYTHONPATH=<visidata_dir>:$PYTHONPATH
$ export PATH=<visidata_dir>/bin:$PATH
```

Further documentation is available at [readthedocs](https://visidata.readthedocs.io/).
