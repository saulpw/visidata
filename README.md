- other [modules are required](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/blob/stable/requirements.txt) for opening particular data sources

VisiData supports tsv, csv, xlsx, hdf5, sqlite, and more.
Use `-f <filetype>` to force a particular filetype.

## Documentation

* Quick reference: `F1` (or `z?`) within `vd` will open the [man page](http://visidata.org/man), which has a list of all commands and options.
* [visidata.org](http://visidata.org) has [asciicasts of its tests](http://visidata.org/test), which serve as example workflows.

## vdtui

The core `vdtui.py` can be used to quickly create efficient terminal workflows.

- [vgit](https://github.com/saulpw/vgit): a git interface
- [vdgalcon](https://github.com/saulpw/vdgalcon): a port of the classic game [Galactic Conquest](https://www.galcon.com)

Other workflows should also be created as separate apps using vdtui.  These apps can be very small; for example, see the included [viewtsv](bin/viewtsv).


## License

The innermost core file, `vdtui.py`, is a single-file stand-alone library that provides a solid framework for building text user interface apps. It is distributed under the MIT free software license, and freely available for inclusion in other projects.

Other VisiData components, including the main `vd` application, addons, loaders, and other code in this repository, are available for reuse under GPLv3.
