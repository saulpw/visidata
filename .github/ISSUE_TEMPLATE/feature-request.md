We want to hear your ideas about where VisiData can go and anything you think could be made smoother.

Please keep in mind that VisiData is not a commercial project and we work on it voluntarily in addition to our paid jobs.
We generally limit our open issues to bugs and small concrete feature requests that are part of the v2.0 roadmap.

If this feature means a lot to you, the reward for the 'True Believer' level on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/saulpw/) is available to satisfy this sort of request.
